Documentation for existing and proposed interactions with the web service.
=====================

This folder contains :
* one [set of diagrams](dataset-create-overview-proposal.md) that shows how we should improve the serialization process of the properties for the datastream and dataprep to store the component properties properly. See the jira [TCOMP-601](https://jira.talendforge.org/browse/TCOMP-601).


* one [set of diagrams](dataset-edit-with-detailed-payload.md) that shows how the middle ware applications such as Dataprep or DataStream enhance the tcomp payload with their own metadata manually and how some daikon helpers could help ease the process. See the jira [TDKN-168](https://jira.talendforge.org/browse/TDKN-168).
